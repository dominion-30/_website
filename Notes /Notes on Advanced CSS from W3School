CSS ROUNDED CORNERS

CSS ROUNDED CORNERS
With the CSS border-radius property, you can give any element "rounded corners"

CSS border-radius property

The CSS border-radius property defines the radius of an element corners.

Tip: This property allows you to add rounded corners to elements!

Tip: The border-radius property is actually a shorthand property for the border-top-left radius, border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-right-radius and border-bottom-left-radius properties.

CSS border-radius -Specify Each Corner.

The border-radius property can have from one to four values. Here are the rules:

Four values-border-radius: 15px 50px 30px 5px; (first value applies to top-left corner, second value applies to top-right corner, third value applies to bottom-right corner, and fourth value applies to bottom-left corner).

Three values- border-radius: 15px 50px 30px; (first value applies to the top-left corner, the second value applies to the top-right and bottom-left corners and the third value applies to the bottom-right corner.

Two values-border-radius: 15px 50px; (first value applies to top-left and bottom-right corners, and the second value applies to the top-right corner and bottom-left corner.)

One value- border-radius: 15px( the value applies to all the four corners, which are rounded equally)

CSS Border Images

CSS Border Images

With the CSS border-image property, you can set an image to be used as the border around an element.


CSS border-image property

The CSS border-image property allows you to specify an image to be used instead of the normal border around an element.

The property has three parts:
1. The image to use as the border
2. Where to slice the image
3. Define whether the middle sections should be repeated or stretched.

Note: The border-image property takes the image and slices it into nine sections, like a tic-tac-toe board. It then places the  corners at the corners, and the middle sections are repeated or stretched as you specify.

FOR border-image to work, the element also needs the border property set!

Here, the middle sections of the image are repeated to create the border:

border: 0.5em solid transparent;
border-image: url(path to image);
padding: 0.5em;


Here, the middle section of the image are stretched to create the border.

Note: The border-image property is actually a shorthand property for the border-image-source, border-image slice, border-image-width, border-image-outset and border-image-repeat properties.
